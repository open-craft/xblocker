# The XBlock API does not contain a mechanism for reading XBlock data
# (block IDs and field data) out of XML. Instead, it only has the
# parse_xml family of methods which read XML, initialize XBlocks based
# on the XML and assign them _new_ IDs, then use the XBlock field API
# to write new values into each XBlock field based on the XML content.

# This means that without any optimization, merely trying to _read_
# XBlock data from XML will result in a whole bunch of field _writes_.
# There is no simple way to distinguish these 'writes' upon XML parsing
# from 'normal' writes wherein the XBlock chooses to modify field values.

# In order to work around this situation without changing the API, we
# require all field reads and/or writes to be part of a
# blockstore_transaction() context; that context is mostly used to know
# when we're using field data, and when it exits the in-memory cache
# is erased. More importantly, all field _writes_ must be wrapped in
# either a collect_changes() or a collect_parsed_fields() context.

# The collect_parsed_fields() context should be used when parsing,
# and it means that writes will be considered to be reads in disguise
# (we're setting the value in memory to match the value in the XML).

# The collect_changes() context should be used when running any
# XBlock view or handler, and it signifies that writes are deliberate
# changes.
